The Vehicle Tracking System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the registration and tracking of vehicles in real-time. 
The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing vehicle data, integrates a mapping service to visualize vehicle locations, and implements authentication to ensure secure access.
The project was developed using Spring Boot for the backend, Hibernate for database interactions, JavaScript for frontend interactions, and an H2 database for data storage.
